## 🔢 Point System Implementation

### **Scoring Rules:**
- ❤️ **Each Like** = +5 points
- 💘 **Match Pick** = +25 points (if mutual)
- 💔 **One-sided Match** = +10 points
- 💕 **Mutual Match Bonus** = +10 points (both players)

### **Example Scoring:**
```
John:
- 2 likes × 5 = 10 points
- Mutual match with Sarah = 25 points
- Mutual match bonus = 10 points
- Total: 45 points

Sarah:
- 2 likes × 5 = 10 points  
- Mutual match with John = 25 points
- Mutual match bonus = 10 points
- Total: 45 points
```

## 🎮 Unity Setup

### **1. Add ShowcaseManager**
1. Create empty GameObject in your scene
2. Add **ShowcaseManager.cs** component
3. Drag your **UIDocument** to `uiDocument` field
4. Create/showcase UXML asset for `showcaseScreenAsset`

### **2. Create Showcase UXML**
Your showcase screen should have these elements:
```xml
<ui:Label name="profile-name-label" />
<ui:Label name="profile-bio-label" />
<ui:VisualElement name="profile-image" />
<ui:Label name="timer-label" />
<ui:Label name="phase-label" />
```

### **3. Trigger Showcase**
In your GameManager, call:
```csharp
// When all profiles are submitted
if (await AreAllProfilesSubmitted())
{
    StartShowcasePhase();
}
```

---

## 📱 JavaScript Setup

### **VotingPage Integration**
The VotingPage automatically handles all phases:

- **Showcase**: Shows current profile with countdown
- **Voting**: Like/Nope buttons with timer
- **Match Pick**: Gallery of all profiles
- **Results**: Final results display

### **Real-time Updates**
Players automatically sync with Unity host:
- Profile changes when Unity updates `showcaseIndex`
- Voting buttons appear/disappear based on `gameState`
- Match pick gallery loads all profiles

---

## 🧪 Testing the Complete Flow

### **1. Test Profile Submission**
1. Unity creates room → Players join
2. Players submit personas/quirks
3. Unity shuffles → Players draw profiles
4. Check Firestore: `rooms/{code}/profiles` should have all profiles

### **2. Test Showcase Phase**
1. Call `StartShowcasePhase()` in Unity
2. Unity should display profiles one by one
3. Players should see profile images and info
4. Check Firestore: `gameState` should be "showcase"

### **3. Test Voting Phase**
1. After showcase, voting should start automatically
2. Players see Like/Nope buttons
3. Votes should appear in Firestore: `profiles/{player}/likes`
4. Check Firestore: `gameState` should be "voting"

### **4. Test Match Pick**
1. After voting, match pick should start
2. Players see gallery of all profiles
3. Picks should appear in Firestore: `profiles/{player}/matchPick`
4. Check Firestore: `gameState` should be "matchpick"

### **5. Test Results**
1. Unity should calculate scores automatically
2. Check Firestore: `scores` and `matches` should be populated
3. Check Unity Console for score breakdown

## 🎯 Game States Flow

```
lobby → pre-profile → profile → showcase → voting → matchpick → results
```

**Unity controls the flow:**
- `gameState` changes trigger phase transitions
- `showcaseIndex` syncs which profile is shown
- Automatic timing for each phase

**Players follow Unity:**
- Listen to `gameState` changes
- Update UI based on current phase
- Submit votes/picks to Firestore

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Showcase Not Starting**
→ Check `StartShowcasePhase()` is called in Unity
→ Verify all profiles are submitted first

### **Voting Buttons Not Appearing**
→ Check `gameState` is "voting" in Firestore
→ Verify VotingPage is listening to state changes

### **Scores Not Calculating**
→ Check ScoringManager.cs is attached to GameObject
→ Verify all profiles have `likes` and `matchPick` data

### **Images Not Loading**
→ Check Firebase Storage URLs are valid
→ Verify Storage rules allow read access
